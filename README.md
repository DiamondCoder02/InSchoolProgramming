> These are all from and for my (hungarian) IT class.
- Back_from_school - Stolen from school. Just if needed in future. **No issues for them!**
- Guess_the_number_Game - Finished homework. Playable if you know how to start .py files.
- Sudoku - Small project for myself. Lazy to make seperate repository. 

- cnt.py - Color and text cheat sheet for myself. Ideas are welcomed!
- menu.py - Basic menu that I should be able to use for most projects.
- run.bat - It's pasicly installs extensions for python, maybe soon python itself too.
> If anyone in my school copies this at least change the code a bit. **I know you.**

Current ideas:
Sudoku, tic-tac-toe

## How to instal and play Guess_the_number_Game:
1. Get python and install it if you don't have it. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
> I did this on 3.9.7, but most 3.X versions should work, I think...
2. While installing make sure to add it to "path" at the bottom then just press install. 
3. When done you should be able to just double click game.py to play.
> Dont forget to download the whole Guess_the_number_Game file or it will not work.
> If douple click does not start it: Where the game.py is, open up a console and type "python game.py" (without "").

If something doesn't work, just make an issue and I will look into it.
